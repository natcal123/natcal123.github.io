Explore whispers from around the world!

This collection is composed of songs that include whispers.
I find music to convey strong emotions that wash over the listeners world.

With the addition of whispers, there is a new level of depth.
Whispers can be associated with many things including the intimate and the creepy.
Comfort and discomfort.

The whisper is such an ethereal and ephemeral auditory space to occupy and to collect.
It's almost as if it doesnâ€™t exist because its weight is so light.
It juxtaposes fullness with emptiness. Intimateness with distance.
And then placing it on the ethereal space of the internet seems like the most fitting collection location.
